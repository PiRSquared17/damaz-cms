# Introduction #

TikiWiki is a very large and in my opinion bloated web site engine.  There are certainly a lot of features and ideas in there, but they aren't all necessary to exist for all sites. Unfortunaly this makes TikiWiki's footprint huge on space, resources and a problem for speed of rendering.
